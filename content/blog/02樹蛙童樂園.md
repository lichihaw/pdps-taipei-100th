臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第二景

第二景遊戲場-樹蛙童樂園

平等的美景與自然生態在都市叢林中是非常少見的，當初在獲得了上級核定通過遊憩場整修的經費之後，平等人就開始全體總動員，大家都在思考如何讓平等的這個遊憩場更加融入平等在地特色，讓平等更加美好、更加亮麗。

在集合了眾人的智慧與建議之後，「樹蛙童樂園」這個構念形成出來了，這樣的想法是希望，以後平等的遊憩場，可以用平等在地的蛙類為核心概念，衍生出整個與自然生態融合饒富童趣的平等新遊憩場。這樣的概念形成之後，與建築師進行多次溝通，產生了「樹蛙童樂園」整體設計圖，再加上營造廠商的配合施工，平等「樹蛙童樂園」於民國105年10月11日竣工，呈現在所有人的面前，並於民國105年11月29日正式啟用。

這個遊憩場是以樹蛙為中心表徵，這一隻大大綠色的樹蛙是集合眾人智慧創新設計出來的，結合溜滑梯的造型，巧妙地融入環境，深富趣味，也成為遊憩場中最重要的標的，另外，遊憩場域中，還有原木賞鳥樹屋，讓人可以遠眺群山，也可以欣賞平等常見的鳥類，遊憩場域中其他的原木遊戲設施，擺脫了傳統罐頭式遊具的迷思，改為以融入環境創新體驗的設計，讓遊戲場成為真正多元啟能的優質遊戲場，更將整個遊戲設施區域整合為一塊可讓人享受自然環境的遊戲休憩場域，營造出在地的特別景緻。

平等「樹蛙童樂園」的完成，讓平等更加美好、更加亮麗，是平等人快樂活動的好地方，更是來到平等朋友們遊憩的好地方，歡迎大家來到平等的「樹蛙童樂園」，共同享受快樂時光並創造美好的回憶。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Second Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Two: The Pingdeng Recreation Area – “Tree Frog Children’s Park”

Pingdeng’s beauty and natural ecology are very rare in the urban jungle. After obtaining the funds approved by our supervisors for renovation of the recreation area, all the members of Pingdeng volunteered to help. Everyone was thinking about how to improve the recreation area. Local characteristics had to be considered because they make Pingdeng brighter and more beautiful.

After gathering wisdom and suggestions from the people, we formed the concept of the "Tree Frog Children’s Park". The idea is that in the future, the native frog species will be the main inspiration and focus of the children’s park— the integration of the school with local natural ecology would create a new Pingdeng recreation area. After the formation of such a concept, the company communicated with the architect several times, resulting in the overall design of the "Tree Frog Children’s Park". Together with the construction company, the Pingdeng "Tree Frog Children’s Park" was completed on October 11, 2016. It was formally presented to the public and officially opened on November 29, 2016.

The focal point of the recreation area is the large green tree frog slide, which embodies the wisdom of the Pingdeng people, is subtly integrated into the environment and is the most important landmark of the recreation field. In the recreation field, there are also bird-watching tree houses which allow visitors to catch views of the native birds of PingDeng birds with the mountains overlooking from high above in the distant background. You can also see wooden playground equipment which is far from the traditional mundane game. The new design integrates the innovative experience provided by the environment, making the recreational field a truly multi-functional recreational space that integrates the entire playground facility area into nature. It allows people to enjoy the natural environment, creating a special view of the ground we stand on.

The completion of the Pingdeng "Tree Frog Children’s Park" makes Pingdeng more beautiful and brighter. It is a good place for Pingdeng people to enjoy activities. It is also a good place to visit  Pingdeng friends and also visit. Welcome everyone to the Pingdeng "Tree Frog Children’s Park". "Let's enjoy a happy time together and create beautiful memories."
