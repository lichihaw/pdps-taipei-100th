臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第十景

第十景司令台-蝴蝶舞台

平等國小的校園生態是相當多元豐富的，值得一提的是校園中經常可以見到到處飛舞的蝴蝶，這些蝴蝶的出現，讓學生在學習上更加豐富有趣。

在眾人的集思廣益與期盼下，多年未整修，冷冰冰的司令臺，終於可以整修了。這次的整修，為了讓這座學生展現學習成果的舞臺，與校園的生態做結合，最終決定以蝴蝶為主軸。融合了校門口的毛毛蟲造型大門，再加上將原本冷冰冰的司令臺改為學生成果展現的「蝴蝶舞臺」，讓平等的校園更加亮麗。這座蝴蝶舞台將成為平等的重要地標，因此舞臺週邊的地坪也配合一併改為友善環境的透水鋪面。這項工程是平等創校以來施工範圍最大也是最艱困的工程，當然這項工程也會受到各方面的責難與遭遇困境。但是在眾人的努力與支持下，總算完成了這項艱鉅的任務，這也是平等校園造景系列的最終章-第十景-「蝴蝶舞臺」。

「蝴蝶舞臺」矗立在平等國小的校園中，就好像一隻大蝴蝶無時無刻地陪伴著學生學習成長，而這隻校園中的大蝴蝶與校門口毛毛蟲造型大門上的圖案相呼應，圖案中毛蟲蝴蝶相互交融各10隻取其十全十美之意，兩相結合，即是平等學生的學生學習展現是十全十美的。走在平等校園環境友善的地坪上，可以感受與大自然的無縫交流，平等校園的美景自然流露，等著您來體驗。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Tenth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Ten: Commander's Desk - Butterfly Stage

The campus ecology of the small country is quite diverse. It is worth mentioning that the butterflies that can be seen everywhere are often seen on campus. The appearance of these butterflies makes students’ lives more interesting and makes students more interested in their studies.

Under the brainstorming and expectations of everyone, the commander's desk, which has not been refurbished for many years, was finally renovated. The inspiration for this refurbishment, was to  provide students with a stage to showcase what learning results, combined with the ecology of the campus. We decided, in the end, to use the butterfly as the main inspiration and focal point of the art. The caterpillar style door that incorporates the school gate, combined with the original cold-skinned commander desk, added to the "butterfly stage" of student achievement, making the Pingdeng campus more beautiful. This butterfly stage will become an important landmark for Pingdeng, such that the floor around the stage was replaced by a permeable eco-friendly pavement. This project is the largest and most difficult project since the establishment of the school. Of course, this project was initially  criticised and troubled all involved parties. However, with the efforts and support of everyone, this arduous task was finally completed. This is also the final chapter of the Pingdeng Campus Landscaping Series - Tenth Sight - "Butterfly Stage".

The "Butterfly Stage" stands on the campus of the Pingdeng State. It is like a big butterfly accompanying students who are continuously and perpetually learning and growing. The big butterfly on this campus echoes the pattern on the door of the caterpillar on the school gate. The caterpillars and butterflies are mutually blended with each other to embody the tenth sight with their perfection. The combination of the two is to echo that the students who are Pingdeng students learn to show that they are perfect. Walking on the inviting Pingdeng campus environment, you can feel the seamless communication with nature, and the beauty of the Pingdeng campus is naturally exposed waiting for you to experience it.
