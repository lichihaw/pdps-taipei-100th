臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第七景

第七景游泳池-蝌學泳池

平等國小是一座小型的山區學校，但麻雀雖小五臟俱全，擁有一座三個水道的露天游泳池，是學生學習游泳的好地方。

平等的游泳池相當特別，首先是採用山區的簡易自來水，也就是山泉水，因此水質相當純淨。其次是與環境的友善，因為是露天的游泳池，所以每年在秋冬季低溫時，會暫停使用六個月。而這段人不使用的期間，平等的游泳池就相當大方的給動物們使用，而使用最多的就是在地的物種-蝌蚪。在這六個月中滿池的蝌蚪，帶給平等無限生機，而蝌蚪成長後成為地青蛙，更成為校園中的生力軍，每天鳴叫為學校加油。

平等游泳池在多年後的整修，我們將友善環境的元素-蝌蚪，與教育學習的本質-學生，做一個緊密的結合，因此命名為成為「蝌學泳池」。另外，在泳池外的壁面，巧妙地融入校本課程的鵝尾山步道，和學生學習游泳的方式，與校園常見的蛙類QRCode等，希望學生能更加快樂的在「蝌學泳池」中學習。「蝌學泳池」是個很特別的地方，歡迎有大家有空來看看，平等的「蝌學泳池」歡迎大家喲。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Seventh Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Seven:  Swimming Pool – Tadpole Study Pool

               
Even though Pingdeng Elementary School is small and resides in the mountain, it has a variety of facilities. For example, it is equipped with an open-air swimming pool with three waterways, which is a good place for students to learn to swim.

The swimming pool in Pingdeng is quite special. Firstly, it simply uses tap water from the mountains, which is the spring water, so the water quality is quite pure. Secondly, it is environmentally friendly. Because it is an outdoor open swimming pool, it will be closed for six months every year when the weather is cold in the autumn and winter. During this period of non-use, the Pingdeng swimming pool is generously shared with the animals, and the most frequent species user of the area is the tadpole. In the past six months, the hustle and bustle of the pool has brought Pingdeng an infinite vitality, and when the tadpole grows up, it becomes a land frog, and they become a new force on the campus. Every day, the frogs are called to cheer for the school.

After the renovation of the Pingdeng swimming pool for many years, we have made a synergistic combination of the elements of a friendly environment and the essence of education and learning, so we named it a “Tadpole Study Pool”. In addition, on the wall outside the pool, the Goose's Hill Trail— which is a clever integration of the school-based curriculum, the way students learn to swim, and the common frog QRCode on campus— embodies the hope that students can learn more in the “learning pool”. The "Tadpole Study Pool" is a very special place. The Pingdeng "Tadpole Study Pool" welcomes you to have a look at it.
