藝術中心希望透過各種層次的「藝術參與」，營造活潑的社區藝術生活。不管是由我們自行策劃，或與專業單位合作，都以創造藝術社群與清大的互動為主要目標。一方面，藝術中心策劃主辦精彩的藝術活動；另一方面，我們也在校園內參與改造許多藝術空間，如清大合勤廳、教育館藝術空間、陽光走廊、大禮堂等，鼓勵更多元的藝文管道，例如藝術性學生社團、商業團體、藝術基金會等類型的展演，也都能在校園蓬勃發展。

NTHU arts center exhibits about six scheduled art performances annually in exhibition hall so far, and artworks from middle-aged taiwanese artists are the main target for our exhibition. The art workshop behind Education Building also holds several exhibitions annually, and we especially welcome artists who do not have many chance to get into commercial art gallery system to exhibit their artworks in NTHU. Besides faculties and staffs on campus, people who live in communities near NTHU and downtown area are also our main audience. NTHU arts center carefully schedules every exhibition to show diversified forms and artistic contents. We would like to introduce the sense and perspective from contemporary art to embody the elements of truth, goodness and beauty in art. Our website provides exhibition introduction and related information for all the audience who are interested in. We expect to present our visual art in an interactive and meaningful way between artists and audience. Besides exhibition hall and art workshop, there are Sunshine Corridor, Education Building 1F and art space in Humanities and Social Sciences Building.
