臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景

緣起

四年前來到平等，一踏進校園就發現這裡真是世外桃源人間仙境，但是由於沒有整體性的規劃與整修，因此這份美景，很難與外人分享。

於是個人一直苦思應該如何讓外界知道平等的這份美景，於是為平等造景，「平等十景」的概念，浮現於腦海中。但這真是一份艱鉅的任務，因為不僅要有縝密的規劃、經費的籌措，連眾人的支持也是重要關鍵之一。因此只能努力將校園美景的優勢加以統整，開始平等造景的序列工作。

首先第一景是「平等四季」，「平等四季」是得到眾人支持後，由全校親師生的動員，將校門口外將近四百公尺的大牆面完成美化的工作。其次，第二景是複雜的「樹蛙童樂園」以及後續的造景序列。其實每個景的難度都很高，例如，第四景的「金迎平等」，「金迎平等」募得的經費只有四萬元，但是，光校名的金色雕刻字體，連工帶料，估價後就需要七萬八千元，經費嚴重不足，後來只得尋遍全國，找出金色雕刻字體最便宜的地方，然後將字體買來，自己出勞力，自己貼字，來撙節經費。又例如最後的第十景-「蝴蝶舞臺」，由於工區遍及全校，又有法規諸多的限制，堪稱平等創校後最艱鉅的工程，在眾人的支持下，歷經許多辛酸與波折，才順利的完成，平等造景的序列工作真是勞心又勞力。

如今，「平等十景」的建置總算是完成了，「平等十景」建構出亮麗的校園，提供了平等學生們良好的學習環境，讓優美環境無形中提升學生學習的效能。平等的校園是美麗的，學習環境是溫馨友善的，學生是幸福快樂的，願將這份平等的美好與外界分享，達到共享共榮的願景。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

Ten Sights of Pingdeng

Origin

I first arrived at Pingdeng four years ago. When I stepped onto the campus, I found that it was a paradise on earth. But, because there was no overall restoration planning or renovation, this beautiful scenery was difficult to share with outsiders.

Therefore, I began thinking about how to let the outside world know the beauty of Pingdeng, so the concept of the "Ten Sights of Pingdeng" came to mind. But, this was a really arduous task because not only is careful planning and financing required, but also the support of the school community. Therefore, we had to work hard to integrate the natural assets of beauty on campus while also beginning the scheduled landscaping work.

The first sight is "Four Seasons of Pingdeng". With the support of all the teachers, staff and students of the whole school, the beautification of the wall located nearly 400 meters outside the school gate was completed. The second sight is the playground complex named the " Tree Frog Children’s Park"; it is succeeded by subsequent landscaping sights in sequence. 

In fact, it was very difficult to obtain funding for each sight. For example, we were only able to raise 40,000 yuan for the "Jin Ying Pingdeng" of the fourth sight; however, after evaluation the estimate for the golden engraving of the school name alone costed 78,000 yuan. The funds were seriously insufficient. Thus, we searched the whole country to find the cheapest producer for the golden engraving for the school welcome sign. Then, we bought the four characters, and posted them ourselves to pay for the expenses. 

Another example of the complexity of these sights was the last sight - "The Butterfly Viewing Areas". Because the areas were spread throughout the school, and there were many restrictions due to regulations, it was the most arduous project after the creation of the school. Everyone involved experienced bitterness with all the twists and turns. The smooth completion of the sequence of sights was both physically and mentally taxing. 

Now, the construction of the "Ten Sights of Pingdeng" has been completed. The "Ten Sights of Pingdeng" has resulted in a beautiful campus, thereby providing an educational and picturesque environment for the Pingdeng students to enhance the efficiency of their learning. The Pingdeng campus is beautiful, the learning environment is warm and friendly, the students are happy, and we are proud to share our campus’s beauty with the whole world.
