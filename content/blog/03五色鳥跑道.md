臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第三景

第三景操場跑道-五色鳥跑道

位處臺北市士林區平等里，陽明山國家公園東南區鵝尾山旁的臺北市平等國小，校園內風光明媚，生趣盎然，更有著一座完善的操場和跑道，提供教學、運動與休憩之用。由於操場和跑道建置於民國82年，在歷經超過20年以上的使用之後，使得舒適度稍嫌不足，也有些老舊。幸而在眾人努力下，爭取到經費，在106年7月重新整修。

為了讓整修過後的操場和跑道更加貼切平等在地的人文風情及自然生態，賦予深層的生命力，在集合眾人的創新思維下，決定以平等在地常見最絢爛的鳥類-「五色鳥」（學名：Psilopogonnuchalis），作為新跑道的基底，將五色鳥隱含結合於設計中，讓平等的親師生及喜愛平等的好朋友們，更加喜愛這充滿生命力及意涵的新跑道。

五色鳥，因其羽毛有五種顏色而得名。身長約20至23公分，在繁殖時會啄樹洞為巢。叫聲單調而響亮，類似敲木魚「叩叩叩……」，而被稱作「花和尚」。頭部大部份為藍色，額頭和喉部為黃色，前頸有小部份紅色，眼部至耳羽上方及嘴部為黑色，身體多為翠綠色，腳則是鉛灰色。五色鳥的五種顏色-紅、藍、黃、綠、灰，恰好可以形成平等五色跑道的五種顏色。

平等五色跑道的修建，讓平等更具特色，在體育活動進行時，能引發興趣動能，也更加安全舒適。將「五色鳥」意涵融入設計，讓跑道成了學習的有機體，在五色跑道上運動，就好像跟著五色鳥一起翱翔，寰宇任遨遊，也好像在五色鳥的鼓勵守護下，更能展現亮麗表現。這樣深具特色的五色跑道，造就了平等的五色鳥傳奇，也讓隱含五色鳥生命力的新操場和五色跑道，陪伴守護所有平等人，平等五色跑道之五色傳奇正在創造著你我美好的回憶，期待「平等五色跑道」，成為平等人一生中最美的篇章。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Third Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Three: Playground Running Track - Five-Color Bird Running Track

Located in Taipei’s Pingdeng Borough of the Shihlin District in the southeast of Yangming Mountain National Park on Ewei Mountain, the campus scenery of Pingdeng is beautiful and vibrant while also being a perfect area for a sports ground and sports track for teaching, athletics, and relaxation. This area was formerly a sports ground and sports track built in 1993. However, after more than 20 years of use, the facilities were worn and aged. Fortunately, due to everyone’s combined fundraising efforts, the renovations on the decaying sports ground area began in July 2017.   
 
In designing the final product of the sports ground and sports track renovation to suit Pingdeng’s school culture, atmosphere, and surrounding natural environment, the final result was imbued deep vitality and meaning. As everyone involved in the project collectively collaborated and brainstormed, it was decided the commonly seen, yet splendid, Taiwan barbet (scientific name: Psilopogon nuchalis) would be used as the inspiration for the renovation, with its beauty weaved into the design of the new sports track. With the presence of the spirit of the Taiwan barbet within the design, all teachers, staff, students, and those with a love for the school, will come to further treasure and appreciate the sports track because of the meaning of deep vitality embedded.

The name of the Taiwan barbet, also known non-officially as the “Five-Colored Bird”, comes from the fact that the bird has five colors of feathers. It is about 20-23 cm in height. When breeding, the Taiwan barbet will peck a hole for its nest in a tree. Its call is monotonous and loud, similar to a mokugyo’s “knock, knock, knock…” sound; the Taiwan barbet is similar to a “Flower Monk” due to its colors and behavior. Most of the Taiwan barbet’s head is colored blue while its forehead and throat are yellow. The front neck has a small piece of the red while the feathers at its mouth and from its eye to the top of its ears are black. The remainder of its body is mostly green, and the feet are lead-gray. Five-Colored Bird is made of five colors - red, blue, yellow, green, gray; these same colors compose the Pingdeng five-colored lanes’ five colors.

The construction of the five-colored lanes of the sports track is a distinguishing feature of Pingdeng’s sports activities, promoting more interest in physical activity and allowing for a more safe and comfortable environment for the activities to exist in. The integration of the idea of the “Taiwan barbet” in the design transforms the sports track into an organic landmark that inspires and teaches youth to exercise and promotes physical activity. By exercising on the sports track of the Taiwan barbet, it is as if you are soaring together with the Taiwan barbet, traversing the expanse of the sky and all over the universe. Under the guardianship of the Taiwan barbet, individuals are able to showcase brilliance. With the profound meaning and vitality of the five-colored sports track and field, the legacy of the Taiwan barbet continues. This new sports field and track will accompany and protect the Pingdeng people. The five-colored sports track’s legacy will leave us with beautiful memories. We look forward to the “Pingdeng Five-Colored Sports Track” as the most beautiful chapter of our lives.
