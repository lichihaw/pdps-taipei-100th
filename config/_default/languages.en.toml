    description = "Art Workshop was used to be a place where College of Life and Science’s students raised their white rats and a sheep for experimentation. However, when Life and Science Building removed from that place, this space became a laundry room, and also a place that even sold breakfast and there was still written “ Omelet for five dollars” on the wall. It kept barren and at last became a warehouse where to place the cleaning equipments. At the time of President Liu Yulang, NTHU Arts Center sought to convert it into an art lodge which was inspired by the telephone booth exhibition room in Germany. We believe: in a small place, when there is an uninterrupted exhibition of art, it can activate the overall atmosphere."
    description_1 = "The entrance and exit of the sidewalk lane of Kuang-Fu High School, which was nearby NTHU, was manually made by the members of Wood-making club. Wood-making club consisted of a group of young people who had deep affection for 'wood structure'. At first, members of Wood-making club were mainly graduates of NTHU; afterwards, there were members from all walks of life. They spent their weekends to build up Art Workshop by hands. No nails were used throughout the house, all of which were doweled. It was an experimental product and has no nails,so it didn’t rust. Therefore, the wood structure didn’t need to be painted. Decades have passed, while entering this small space, we can still smell the scent of American cedar."
    description_2 = "Art Workshop is ​​about 21 square meters and suitable for graphic works, three-dimensional sculptures, and artistic presentations. Each semester has three to four exhibitions, and this place is suitable for exquisite and small ones. Art Workshop has a large area of ​​glass, like a three-dimensional window. It is such an exquisite and lovely display space. Even if you don't walk into the building, the light from the art workshop can make pedestrians passing through here feel the vividness and warmth of the landscape."
    description_3 = "In autumn 2017, Junxian Huang, the architect of the case, held a solo exhibition at NTHU. After discussion, the original building structure was added with a balcony space, under the conditions that the building is on the cliff. Hence, it extends the entire balcony to increase the coordination between Art Workshop and the overall space with a terrain drop of more than one meter. Art Workshop is already a box-shaped space that can have small performances, which enables NTHU's cultural activities to have diverse developments. After more than ten years of waiting, the architect has finally completed his ideal artistic space."
    description_4 = "Sculpture Park on the grass in front of Art Workshop is a gift from the 08th grade students. With those students’ efforts, the sculptures are completed with collage mosaic. Sculpture Park connects to Exhibition Hall on the first floor of the Education Building, Sunlight Corridor and Art Workshop at the rear. Sculpture Park is located on the green belt of the art exhibition and creative space. Few adults would pass through this area, it can be described as microvessels that pedestrians who are diverted to this path are mostly students. This small space brings a subtle surprise to the passers-by. This place has a wonderful atmosphere, very similar to the formation of the New York SoHo. Interlaced with the vitality of artistic creation, and the ruin of the border area, we hope to plant a warm and lively seed in this park."
    description_5 = "Art Workshop and Sculpture Park prove the diversity of NTHU’s art space successfully. NTHU is a fantastic college that he wish to let art and creation exist not only in the art center or classroom, but everywhere on campus, even the most desolate place. Through students from one session after another, they inherit their spirits in a fantastic way. The development of such place here are coherent to the essence of artistic creation. We dare adventure, be brave to try on everything;last but not least, we continuously pursue the good results."
