臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第九景

第九景生態池-九桉許願池
    
一進到平等的校園，就可以看見到一座生態池，生態池的前面有一棵將近百年的大葉桉木，很美的景觀，令人不得不被吸引而流連駐足欣賞美景。此刻耳邊傳來蟲鳴鳥叫與蛙類的歡唱聲，如此精彩的聲光效果，正是平等校園生態的魅力。

這座生態池之前缺乏整修，池底破損漏水，環池步道荊棘遍佈，根本無法行走，而大葉桉木也因為受限於水泥鋪，無法透水而奄奄一息。所幸在眾人努力與上級單位的支持下，開始整修。把生態池破損漏水處加以修補，並在池中增加九座石踏，環池步道增置植草磚，提供通行，在大葉桉木的週邊，也將原本不透水的水泥鋪面，改為透水鋪面，與環境生態作更加友善的結合。

現在的平等生態池，命名為「九桉生態池」，取其池中有九座石踏隱含長長久久之意，與大葉桉木隱含的平平安安相結合。換言之這是一座庇護平等長長久久、平平安安充滿靈性的生態池。這個生態池中的動植物相當多元精彩，充滿聲光驚喜，歡迎大家有空來實際體驗。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Ninth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Nine: Ecological Pool – Jiuyi Trevi Wish Fountain
               
As soon as you enter the campus of Pingdeng, you can see an ecological pool. In front of the ecological pool, there is a large-leaf eucalyptus tree that has stood for nearly a hundred years. The beautiful landscape is so attractive it makes people unwilling to leave the beautiful scenery. At this moment, your ears hear the sound of birds chirping, insects singing, and the frogs calling. This wonderful sound and beautiful lighting is the charm of the Pingding campus ecology.

The ecological pool was outdated before renovation, and the bottom of the pool was damaged and leaking. The trails of the pool were full of thorns and could not be walked at all. The big leaf eucalyptus (Swamp Mahogany) was dying because its roots were limited by cement, which was not water-permeable. Fortunately, everyone began to refurbish the pool with the support of the superior infrastructural planning. The ecological pool was repaired of damage, and nine stone steps were added into the pool. The grass planting tiles were established around the JiuAn Fountain to provide pedestrian walking access. In the surroundings of the big leaf eucalyptus, the originally impervious cement pavement was changed to permeable paving, a more environmentally-conscious combination with the environment and ecology.

The current Pingdeng ecological pool, named "JiuAn Wish Fountain", has nine stone steps hidden in the pool for longevity, combined with the big leaf eucalyptus for blessings of peace and safety. In other words, this is an ecological pool that promotes long lives, peacefulness, and spirituality. The flora and fauna in this eco-pool is quite diverse and full of sound and surprises. You are welcome to experience it when you have time.
