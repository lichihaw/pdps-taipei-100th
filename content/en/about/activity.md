NTHU arts center exhibits about six scheduled art performances annually in exhibition hall so far, and artworks from middle-aged taiwanese artists are the main target for our exhibition. The art workshop behind Education Building also holds several exhibitions annually, and we especially welcome artists who do not have many chance to get into commercial art gallery system to exhibit their artworks in NTHU. Besides faculties and staffs on campus, people who live in communities near NTHU and downtown area are also our main audience. NTHU arts center carefully schedules every exhibition to show diversified forms and artistic contents. We would like to introduce the sense and perspective from contemporary art to embody the elements of truth, goodness and beauty in art. Our website provides exhibition introduction and related information for all the audience who are interested in. We expect to present our visual art in an interactive and meaningful way between artists and audience. Besides exhibition hall and art workshop, there are Sunshine Corridor, Education Building 1F and art space in Humanities and Social Sciences Building.
