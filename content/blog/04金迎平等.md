臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第四景

第四景校門口景緻-金迎平等

臺北市平等國小校門口這條柏油路是學校的門面，一面是擋土牆，長滿雜草，還有多支粗大的塑膠排水管，另外一面則是陡坡。平時上課日上學時，平等的親師生從家中到學校，校門口這條路是必經之途。

走著走著，看著看著，大家想著，如果在這條路上能夠有提升能量的元素，相信，每日上學時，只要走這條路進入校園，必能以充滿活力的心態，懷著愉悅的心情，迎接每一天學習的開始，享受學校的美好。在這樣的理念想法之下，平等的親師生開始思考，如何來將校門口做一個轉變，於是「金迎平等」校門口造景計劃就此誕生。

校門口的造景分為三階段；首先是動線的重整，將校門口在動線上的兩顆大石頭，也就是作為石敢當的基石移動位置，再移除水泥門擋，將進入校園的動線重新做一個調整；其次是牆面的整理，校門口牆面上有雜草有排水管，有石材也有水泥鋪面，因此介面的美化與整體塑造是相當重要的課題，經過大家的研議討論後，決定以原木木板及不鏽鋼鋼板來做遮蔽，將牆面加以美化，並在原木木板加上金色的校名全銜，讓校門口增加辨識度，金光閃閃煥然一新；最後是資訊的整合，整合跑馬燈資訊、訊息公告、學校榮譽、訪客接待等訊息，將校門口轉化成為具有資訊交換傳遞的多元功能區。

期望透過這樣的改造，「金迎平等」-讓平等的金字招牌迎接每位平等人及來到平等的好朋友，「金迎平等」就是這樣的一個理念，這的想法在獲得無名氏的捐款及學校維護費用的支援下，「金迎平等」終於在民國107年3月23日完成了，從此每天經過平等校門口都能知道最新的訊息，而牆面上的金字招牌也代表著平等在地的熱情，好像伸出雙手似的，熱情歡迎大家來到平等。平等的校門口在「金迎平等」的加持之下，果然是充滿熱情又值得駐足的好地方。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Fourth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Four: The School Gate - Jin Yingping

The tarmac road at the entrance of the Taipei Pingdeng Elementary School was the previous facade of the school. Every time the Pingdeng teachers and students went to school, the only entrance was through this tarmac road. On one side was the retention wall covered with weeds surrounded by many large plastic drain pipes, and on the other side was a steep slope. 

Walking along this path, everyone thought, “If there was a way to provide a positive energy on this road, I believe that when I go to school every day, as long as I take this road into the campus, I will be able to approach my school day with a lively attitude. At the start of each day, we would be able to begin our studies while enjoying the beauty of the school.” Under such an idea, the whole Pingdeng community began to think about how to make a change in the school gate, so the "Jin Ying Ping Deng" school gate landscaping plan was born.

The landscaping at the entrance of the school was divided into three stages. The first is the re-engineering of the entrance walking path. Two large stones were placed on either side of the entrance of the school gate, as “shi gan dang” (traditional ornamental stone tablets that ward off evil) replacing the old concrete door stop. After the entrance walking path was adjusted, the second area of improvement was the finishing of the wall. There were weeds and drains on the wall of the school gate and uneven patches of stone and cement paving. Therefore, the beautification and overall uniformity of the wall were very important topics. After discussion, it was decided the wall would be covered with wooden planks and stainless steel plates and the school name in gold would be added to these wooden planks to increase recognition that these were the school gates . The golden glow was completely new. The final area of improvement was the installation of an electronic marquee which would display announcements, school honors, visitor receptions, and welcome information. This transformed the school gate into a multi-functional area with information exchange, welcoming all visitors and Pingdeng students and staff daily.

It is hoped that through such a transformation, the concept of the golden "Jin Yin Ping Deng" sign will welcome all members of the school community and visitors. Anonymous donors supported this welcoming concept, so with their support supplementing the school maintenance fees, the golden "Jin Ying Ping Deng" was finally completed on March 23, 2018.  The latest information could now be obtained every day through the entrance of the Pingdeng School. 

The gold sign on the wall represents Ping Deng’s warmth. The enthusiasm seems to stretch out its hands and warmly welcomes everyone to Pingdeng. Under the blessing of "Jin Ying Ping Deng", the Pingdeng school gate is truly a warm place full of enthusiasm worth visiting.
