臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第五景

第五景校園石敢當-櫻花守護石

平等的氣候與自然環境非常適合栽種櫻花，每年一月份到四月份在平等里所種植的櫻花紛紛綻放，燦爛的花海成為舉國聞名的熱門景點，當然平等校園裡也不免俗的種了幾棵櫻花樹，在行政大樓及彩虹地景旁所種的櫻花最具有代表性，這棵櫻花樹是民國85年所栽種，佇立在校園中已經長達22年了。

原本孤單的櫻花樹，大家思考著如何讓它更加熱鬧、更加具有教育意義，恰好在民國107年校門口進行了造景的活動，在校門口守護平等多年的石敢當需要移動位置，兩相結合後，於是產生了「櫻花守護石」的想法。

在校園內櫻花樹旁加入了一顆守護石，讓櫻花樹與石敢當結合，得到了圓滿。這顆「櫻花守護石」原本是在校門口擔任石敢當的工作，矗立在校門口，對外，守護著平等所有親師生的平安，在校門口改善工程中，我們將這顆深具內涵意義原本在校門口守護大家的石敢當，移置到櫻花樹旁成為矗立在校園中，對內，守護著平等所有親師生平安的「櫻花守護石」。

這樣的安排，讓原本對校外的守護，轉化為守護校園內的守護基石。「櫻花守護石」在校園中形成了一股安定的力量，保佑著平等全體親師生的平安，更是一個美麗的景點，這座「櫻花守護石」將永遠屹立在平等的校園中，成為守護校園的基石。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Fifth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Five: The Campus Stone Dare - Cherry Guardian Stone

The Pingdeng climate and natural environment are very suitable for planting cherry blossoms. The cherry blossoms planted in Pingdeng from January to April bloom each year, and the splendid flower sea has become a popular tourist attraction in Taiwan. So naturally, Pingdeng planted a few cherry trees of campus. The cherry blossom tree planted next to the administrative building is the most representative cherry blossom tree on campus of the vibrant rainbow landscape. This cherry tree was planted in 1996 and has been standing on campus for 22 years.

Aspiring to make the cherry tree more lively and its meaning more educational, the landscaping activities began in 2018 around the original cherry tree. One of the shi gan dang stone guards, which have been guarding Pingdeng for many years at the school gate, was proposed to be moved into position near the tree. Subsequently, I came up with the idea of the "Sakura guardian stone," Yin Hua Shou Hu Shi.

A guardian stone was added next to the cherry tree on the campus. This "Sakura Guardian Stone" was originally a Yin Hua Shou Hu Shi at the school gate. It stood at the school gate and guarded the peace of all teachers and students. The significance of the guardian stone was embodied in the school gate improvement project. Shi Dingdang, which was originally guarding everyone at the school gate, moved to the cherry tree and became a "sakura guardian stone" standing on the campus and guarding the peace of all the teachers and students.

This arrangement has transferred the original position of “guardianship of the school” into a “guardianship of the campus”. The "Sakura Guardian Stone" has formed a stable force on the campus, blessing the peace of all the teachers and students and is a beautiful attraction. This "Sakura Guardian Stone" will always stand on Pingdeng’s campus and become the cornerstone of the campus.
