臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第一景

第一景校門口壁畫-平等四季

平等美景，隨著季節變化各有特色，本壁畫作品以一條河流，串起平等在地春、夏、秋、冬的美麗風光，也隱含平等國小學生在德、智、體、群、美各方面卓越的表現，更將平等三亮點：「生態、傳藝、樂學」，巧妙地融入在作品當中。

本壁畫作品構思於105年10月，由時任校長黎季昊、教務主任黃瑋筠、學輔主任張家齊、總務主任邱聖富，共同籌畫，並委由平等國小校友徐令穎，擔任總主筆繪製工作。歷經半年籌畫，並得到無名氏先生贊助經費下，於106年4月11日起，得以順利開始繪製工作。繪製期間由平等國小校友、平等國小親師生及各方支持平等的好伙伴，共同協助，參與彩繪。在大家齊心協力下，運用一個半月的時間，完成了「平等四季」這幅作品，並於106年5月19日正式揭幕，發表啟用。

「平等四季」是屬於全平等人的榮耀，體現出平等的人文、地理、特色及文化，更讓大家進一步認識平等，共同讓平等更加美好。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The First Sight of Pingdeng

The School Entry Gate Mural - Four Seasons of Pingdeng
The beautiful landscape of Pingdeng Elementary exhibits unique aspects of each season. The river mural is not only a portrait that strings together stunning spring, summer, autumn and winter scenery imagery, but also demonstrates the moral, intellectual, physical, and social excellence of the students of Pingdeng Elementary. There are three highlighted themes in this work—Eco-Friendliness, Cultural Heritage, and Joyful Learning— which are integrated in the imagery. These themes are also Pingdeng Elementary’s core pillars.

The mural was conceived in October 2016 during a meeting between the then-Principal Chi-Haw Li (黎季昊), the Dean of Education Wei-Yun Huang (黃瑋筠), the Student Director Jia-Chi Jang (張家齊), and the General Affairs Director Sheng-Fu Chiu (邱聖富). Soon after, Pingdeng alumni, Ling-Ying Hsu (徐令穎), was appointed as the Director of Illustration. After six months of planning, and with the generous financial sponsorship from a benefactor, work formally began on April 11, 2017 and progressed smoothly. During the timeframe of the project, numerous partners from all backgrounds and levels of association with Pingdeng Elementary actively participated and contributed to the mural’s completion, including the Pingdeng students, staff, alumni, and other parties. With concerted efforts from all the partners who were united in the common cause, after one and a half-month’s time, "Four Seasons of Pingdeng" was completed. The mural was unveiled in a ceremony on May 19, 2017. 

 “Four Seasons of Pingdeng” represents the honor of Pingdeng Elementary and serves as a testament to the numerous individuals who have been influenced and shaped through connection to the school, reflecting and highlighting the school’s culture, location, and special characteristics. Our culture allows everyone - students, teachers, administrators, and visitors alike- to develop a deeper understanding of Pingdeng, allowing the school to grow more beautiful and diverse.
