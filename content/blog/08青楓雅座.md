臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第八景

第八景休憩座椅-青楓雅座

平等中庭有一顆青楓樹，每年秋天一到，寒意乍現實，這棵青楓樹就會換上新裝與大家見面，由原本綠色的外衣，瞬間改換成燦爛的艷紅色，令人讚嘆。

青楓樹下有兩座石桌椅供人休憩，在這個「青楓雅座」坐下之後會發現，不但景色優美，清風徐徐，更是讓人感到心曠神怡。春夏時葉是綠的，可以遮陽避暑，而秋冬時葉是紅的，可以欣賞休憩。真可說是一年四季各有千秋，特別若是斟上一杯熱茶，在夜晚坐下，實在是會有李白所言之，「舉杯邀明月、對影成三人」的意境。

「青楓雅座」是一處令人放鬆的休憩去處，可以讓人完全放鬆，而「青楓雅座」旁邊生態池中的錦鯉，與青楓樹相襯，更讓人覺得平等還真是一處人間仙境。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Eighth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

Eight:  Rest Seat - QingFeng (Acer Serrulatum) Booth
               

Every autumn, when the weather turns chilly, the green maple tree will be replaced with a new autumn dress. From the original green coat, it will be changed into a brilliant red color. It is amazing to see.

Under the green maple tree, there are two stone tables and chairs for people to rest. After sitting down in this "QingFeng Booth", you will find the beautiful scenery and breeze that makes people feel relaxed and happy. In spring and summer, the leaves are green and act as shade to block the heat. In autumn and winter, the leaves are red and you can enjoy the scenery and rest. It truly embodies the different views of each of the four seasons in the whole year, especially if you take a cup of hot tea and sit down at night, matching with what Tang dynasty famous poet Li Bai said, "I raise my chalice to invite the shining moon, the moon casts me a shadow and we have unity".

"Qingfeng Booth" is a relaxing place to unwind, and the koi in the ecological pool next to the "Qingfeng Booth" is in-line with the Acer Serrulatum trees. It makes people feel that Pingdeng is really a paradise on Earth.
