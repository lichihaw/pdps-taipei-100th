臺北市士林區平等國民小學校園美景系列

平等十景之第六景

第六景麵包窯-石榕麵包窯

每個學期的期末時刻，平等都會辦理「窯烤慶豐收」的活動。這個活動是因為平等國小是臺北市小田園食農教育的績優學校，平等國小的學生們，都能在小田園的教學活動中享受到自己種植農作物的知識與樂趣，而「窯烤慶豐收」就是在期末的一項成果驗證活動。學生們必須將自己所種植的農作物，加以料理成為佳餚，體現自給自足的價值，而這時平等的「麵包窯」就必須要登場了。

平等的麵包窯是由何日熙老師親自帶領著學生不假外人之手，一磚一瓦，靠自己的力量堆砌起來的，也因此，麵包窯上滿滿充斥者師生合作的痕跡。在麵包窯旁邊的榕樹更是堪稱一絕，橫向的枝幹，彷彿是張開雙臂，熱情的迎接大家的到來，將大家環抱擁入懷中，一旁的石桌椅相襯，讓大家在欣賞平等美景或窯烤時，還可以稍事休息。

石桌椅、大榕樹、麵包窯三個元素，在平等的校園的一隅，建構出雋永的景緻-「石榕麵包窯」。「石榕麵包窯」這個景點，不但美，而且還非常實用，平等的石榕麵包窯」歡迎您來造訪。

Taipei Municipal Pingdeng Elementary School Beautiful Campus Landscape Series

The Sixth Pingdeng Sight of the Ten

The Sixth Sight Bread Kiln – Shi-Rong Bread Kiln

               
At the end of each semester, Pingdeng Elementary School will host an event called “Bread Kiln to Celebrate the Harvest Season.” Pingdeng was nominated as an outstanding campus for its gardening and little-farm education in Taipei. The students of Pingdeng really enjoy planting crops and vegetables by themselves and learning the skills from the farming experience. The “Bread Kiln to Celebrate the Harvest Season” event is truly an opportunity to validate the harvest result. Students must make their own crops into a delicious dish that reflects the value of self sufficiency by “Bread Kiln.”

The whole process of “Bread Kiln” was originally led by Teacher RiXi He. Each brick and tile of “Bread Klin” was built by the students and Teacher He with great memory and teamwork. The banyan tree beside the bread kiln is significantly unique, as well. The horizontal branches are like open arms embracing anyone’s approach with a warm welcome. The stone tables and chairs on the side provide a rest area so you can not only cook the food, but also enjoy the beautiful campus view.

The three characters of the stone tables and chairs, big banyan tree, and bread kiln in one campus corner of Pingdeng create a historical view-”Stone Banyan Bread Kiln”. This attraction is beautiful and very practical. We welcome you to visit it anytime.
